1. Sign-Up (Registration) Process
   -----------------------------
   
Description: The sign-up process allows new users to create an account by providing their details. This process involves collecting user information, validating the input, and storing the user data in the database.

Steps:

User Input: The user fills out a registration form with their details, such as username, password, first name, last name, email, and phone number.

Validation: The system validates the input to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly and the input meets any specified criteria (e.g., password strength, unique username).

Data Storage: Once validated, the user data is stored in the database, and the user account is created.

2.Sign-In (Login) Process
-------------------------
Description: The sign-in process allows existing users to access the system by authenticating themselves with their credentials.

Steps:

User Input: The user fills out a login form with their username and password.

Validation: The system validates the input to ensure the fields are not empty.

Authentication: The system checks the credentials against the stored user data in the database.

Access Granted: If the credentials are correct, the user is granted access and redirected to the home page. If the credentials are incorrect, an error message is displayed.



These explanations and sample code snippets outline the essential steps and logic for the sign-up and sign-in processes in your Expense Tracker Management System. You can expand upon these basic implementations to include additional features such as password encryption, email verification, and more comprehensive error handling.
